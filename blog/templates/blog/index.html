                            <h3> I dont exactly remember when I first started watching anime, but it was last year or so and my brother suggested to watch demon slayer because he really loved it and the animations on it are sickkkkk. And couldn't stop watching it since then. also I rly love the fact that every single demon had a depressing and sad past and they just get killed by tanjiro and Nezuko. The next one I watched was spy x family. and Anya is soo tricking cutee aaaoihwrgwirgpehogh.
